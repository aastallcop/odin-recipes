# odin-recipes

This is a cooking webpage that consist a collection of recipes of meals I like to cook in my free time.

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated my foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS to make a basic and simple webpage that is easy to read and understand. It will also show that I understand how to use Git.
